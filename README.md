# R projects
Models that I have built in R. The models that I have built are all using R programming and I have used almost every algorithm that is possible. These projects were completed during my course in Data Analytics. I, however, no longer work in R as I have migrated to Python. Please feel free to go through the projects and please comment if you have doubt regarding anything. Thank you.
